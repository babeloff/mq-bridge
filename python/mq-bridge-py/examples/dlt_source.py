"""Use mq-bridge as a bounded, deferred-ack source for a `dlt` pipeline.

This is the split that warehouse loaders (e.g. omniload) need: mq-bridge consumes
and yields raw records, `dlt` owns the write (normalize → stage → merge), and
mq-bridge acks **only after** the load package is committed. If the load fails,
the batch is never acked and the broker redelivers it — so the merge below MUST be
idempotent (note `primary_key` + `write_disposition="merge"`).

Key API: `poll_batch(max, timeout_ms) -> (records, token)` returns a batch without
acking and hands back a token; `ack(token)` commits that batch; `nack(token)`
releases it for redelivery. Contrast with `poll()` + `commit()`, which acks every
outstanding batch at once — fine for strict poll→handle→commit loops, but the token
form is what lets you ack exactly the batch `dlt` just persisted.

Runs brokerless over an in-memory endpoint, so no services are required. Swap the
ENDPOINT dict for a broker (kafka/nats/amqp/…) and the loop is unchanged.

Requires `dlt` (an example-only dependency, not needed to use mq-bridge):
    pip install "dlt[duckdb]"
    python examples/dlt_source.py
